# Defect log

Defects reported by the owner, one entry each. An entry stays until the fix is
merged and the owner's scenario was re-run; then it moves to the closed list
with the commit that closed it.

## Open

### Impersonation by display name, and a freed username taken instantly
Raised 2026-08-19 while answering whether a stranger can register someone
else's username (they cannot: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,32}`, UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE,
the race resolved by the index). What remains: the display name is free text —
three accounts named «Akuz» differ only by the small @handle in search — and a
renamed account's old username is up for grabs the same second, so whoever
watches it inherits the searches for @oldname. Worth deciding: highlight the
@handle in search, a cool-down before a freed name re-enters circulation.

### Interaction smoothness below Telegram
Reported 2026-08-18. Overall animation quality and frame pacing feel worse
than Telegram across the app. Umbrella item; closes on the owner's judgement,
not on a single fix. Measured so far (bubbleanim run, merged 14c3a0a): no
frame over 36 ms in the reaction windows, `feed.ui.apply` ≤ 3 ms.

## Closed

### Unread counts must work offline, and the read must reach the server later
Reported 2026-08-19. Closed by the live run in
`runs/2026-08-19-offlineread-run.md`, no code change: 5 unread accumulated on
the chat list, the stand was killed, opening the chat dropped the counter to 0
with no network, and after the stand returned the sender's messages went to
read ticks with no unread resurrection on the reader after sync.

### Unread count inflated in group chats
Reported 2026-08-19. Reproduced by a red server-smoke check before any product
change: with one unread message, a service frame and a second message, the
push badge said 3 where the reader had two messages to open (d09b138); the
device row inflated the same way (`UnreadCountTests`). Fixed by counting
unread in content rather than in seqs — the server keeps a running content
count stored on every message (8eb1899), the device counts only frames that
take the chat further than it has ever been (d36f0cc). Merged in e4f1ea0,
gate green.

### Bubble resize on a reaction change is not animated
Reported 2026-08-18. Closed in 14c3a0a: `refreshItem` reconfigures the visible
cell inside a 0.35 s spring with `performBatchUpdates` in the same animation —
the bubble grows in place, neighbours slide, contentOffset holds; reaction
capsules are reused per emoji, media survives without a BlurHash flash. The
width-only inline-reaction case animates too. Frame-by-frame evidence in
docs/qa/runs/2026-08-19-bubbleanim/.

### Long-press on a bubble has no animation
Reported 2026-08-18. Closed in 14c3a0a: a 0.1 s press dips the bubble to 0.96,
a 12 pt finger move releases it (scroll unaffected), and the context menu
lifts from the pressed state — the overlay snapshot starts at the presentation
layer's current scale, so the touch flows into the lift without a seam.

### Read tick colour invisible, single tick oversized
Reported 2026-08-18. Closed by 95c03a3: the read tick got its own hue per
theme, the single tick the same glyph size as one of the pair.

### Back button in the chat header oversized
Reported 2026-08-18 (third time). Closed by 95c03a3: the custom button now
draws the system chevron at the system size, kept only for the `chat.back`
accessibility identifier; the header title sits on a capsule ground.
